The nomenclature is as follows:
{dataset name}_{Model Architecture}

Project Descriptions:
Mnist_FC:
  Fully connected network with one hidden layer trained on the mnist dataset.
  Uses Functional API, which is overkill, but I wanted to try it out.

Fashion_Mnist_CNN:
  CNN trained on the fashion mnist dataset.
  Given is the architecture that performed well.
  Uses Sequential API.

Titanic_EDA:
  Ran EDA on the popular titanic dataset.
  Used all vanilla classifiers in scikit learn and tuned their hyperparameters to achieve an accuracy of 77%.
  Used pyTorch to create a Neural Net classifier and trained it.
